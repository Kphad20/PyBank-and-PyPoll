# PyBank
In this challenge, I will create a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. I will give a set of financial data (from Resources folder - budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.
</br></br>
My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
</br>- The total number of months included in the dataset
</br>- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
</br>- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
</br>- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
</br>- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
</br></br>
In addition, my final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

# PyPoll
In this challenge, I am tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.
</br></br>
I will be given a set of poll data (from Resources folder - election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
</br>- The total number of votes cast
</br>- A complete list of candidates who received votes
</br>- The percentage of votes each candidate won
</br>- The total number of votes each candidate won
</br>- The winner of the election based on popular vote.
</br></br>
In addition, my final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
